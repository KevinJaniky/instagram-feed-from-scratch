<h1>Instagram Feed with PHP from Scratch</h1>

I build this app with a composer package. To use this package we must create a token on <a href="http://instagram.pixelunion.net/">Pixel
union</a> ( Its free ). Thanks to this token , you will be able to access the API. ( for more informations you can read doc on <a href="https://github.com/pgrimaud/instagram-user-feed">Github</a>).


Replace <strong>TOKEN_REPLACE</strong> by your token on config.php files.

Replace <strong>000000</strong> by the first part of your token. 

Replace <strong> your-instagram-account</strong> by the first part of your token. 


    1245784502.aaaaaa.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa <=== TOKEN 
    1245784502   <=== CLIENT ID

You don't need a mysql Server or another SGBD
